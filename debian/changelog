ros-melodic-trac-ik (1.3.0-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Added a mode to TRAC-IK constructor that determines how the IK solver
    runs: 1) Speed return immediately whenever any solution is found (all other
    modes run for the requested timeout to try to find multiple solutions); 2)
    Distance runs for the timeout and returns the solution found that minimizes
    the Sum-of-Squares error from the seed; 3) Manip1 returns the solution that
    maximizes the manipulation metric sqrt(det(J*J^T)); 4)  Manip2 returns the
    metric that minimizes the condition number J* J^-1.
  * Added support for these modes in the MoveIt! plugin via the kinematic.yaml
    parameter solve_type, which can be one of the strings "Speed", "Distance",
    "Manipulation1", "Manipulation2".

    desired.

ros-melodic-trac-ik (1.2.0-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Extended TRAC-IK to both run in two ways: 1) the old mode of first IK
    solution found causes TRAC-IK to return immediately, versus 2) the new mode
    where TRAC-IK runs for the full requested timeout duration, then sorts all
    solutions according to distance from the seed and returns the minimum.
  * Made MoveIt! support this new IK run mode if the user desires.
  * Improved timing info to use a higher solution clock.
  * Fixed TRAC-IK's abort/reset of KDL-RR and NLOpt-IK to catch race
    conditions.

  * Fixed issue where clamping a seed to be within the joint limits might still
    have values outside the limits.
  * Fixed issue where MoveIt! plugin was not thread safe.
  * Fixed an issue in MoveIt! plugin where error_code passed in uninitialized
    to SUCCESS could cause IK to say it failed when it did not.
